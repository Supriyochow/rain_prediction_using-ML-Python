# rain_prediction_using-ML-Python

This is a program that predicts the possibilities of rain for the next day. The data is inputed for a certain day and it predicts the rain possibilities for the next day. 

## Dataset Source
The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website. The dataset link is given https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package
 
## Python Frameworks used
The Python frameworks used for this project are:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
The entire program is done in Jupyter Notebook

## k Nearest neighbors Classification algorithm is used in this case to build a less complex model.
